# esanin

**An easy-to-use Bash script to build and install Enlightenment 24 on Focal Fossa or Groovy Gorilla :kiss:**

See also [ekatsuki.sh](https://github.com/batden/ekatsuki) (companion script).

## Get started

First, clone this repository (you need the *git* command installed) from a terminal window:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/esanin.git .esanin
```

This creates a new hidden folder named **.esanin** in your home directory.

Please copy the file esanin.sh from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x esanin.sh
```

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./esanin.sh
```

On subsequent runs, open a terminal and simply type:

```bash
esanin.sh
```

(Use tab completion: Just type *esan* and press Tab)

### Update local repository

Be sure to check for updates at least once a week.
In order to do this, change to ~/.esanin/ and run:

```bash
git pull
```

That's it.

Mind the cows! :cow2: :cow2: :cow2:
